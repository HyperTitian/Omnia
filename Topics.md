[[Messages]] are routed via a transport system with publish / subscribe semantics. A [[Nodes | node]] sends out a message by publishing it to a given topic. The topic is a name that is used to identify the content of the message. A node that is interested in a certain kind of data will subscribe to the appropriate topic.
